# Machine Learning Analysis Namespace

The Machine Learning Analysis namespace defines classes and
attributes used to describe products generated by machine learning
methods applied to PDS data.  This information provides traceability
for product provenance and credit to the creators.

# Notes

Each build is auto-generated using Github Actions, PDS4 LDDTool, and Validate Tool.

You can manually run [LDDTool](https://nasa-pds.github.io/pds4-information-model/model-lddtool/index.html) on the IngestLDD using the following command:
```
lddtool -lpJ src/PDS4_ML_IngestLDD.xml
```
Note that this command must be run from the location in which `lddtool` was installed.
