# Machine Learning Analysis Local Data Dictionary (LDD)

The Machine Learning Analysis dictionary defines classes and
attributes used to describe products generated by machine learning
methods applied to PDS data.  This information provides traceability
for product provenance and credit to the creators.

## Propose Updates

See the [LDD Update Process](https://pds-data-dictionaries.github.io/development/ldd-update.html)

## Implement

To implement changes the LDD, simply update the IngestLDD under the `src/` directory, commit to a branch, push the branch to Github, and create a Pull Request. The [Github Action CI/CD](https://pds-data-dictionaries.github.io/development/ldd-build.html) will take care of the auto-generation of the schemas and schematrons.

For more information see the [LDD Build Process](https://pds-data-dictionaries.github.io/development/ldd-build.html)

## Notes

Each build is auto-generated using Github Actions, PDS4 LDDTool, and Validate Tool.

You can manually run [LDDTool](https://nasa-pds.github.io/pds4-information-model/model-lddtool/index.html) on the IngestLDD using the following command:
```
lddtool -lpJ -V src/PDS4_ML_IngestLDD.xml
```
Note that this command must be run from the location in which `lddtool` was installed.
